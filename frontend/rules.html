    <h1>Hex: Game Rules</h1>
    
    <h2>Game Overview</h2>
    <p>Hex is a two-player abstract strategy board game played on a hexagonal grid. Players aim to create an unbroken path connecting their opposite sides of the board.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The board is a hexagonal grid (typically 11x11 or 13x13 hexagons).</li>
        <li>Blue player tries to connect the north and south sides of the board.</li>
        <li>Red player tries to connect the east and west sides of the board.</li>
        <li>Players take turns placing their color stone on an empty hexagon.</li>
        <li>Once a stone is placed, it cannot be moved.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Winning</h2>
    <p>The first player to create an unbroken path connecting their two opposite sides wins the game. This path can zigzag across the board but must touch only the player's own colored hexagons.</p>
    
    <h2>Things to know:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No draws are possible in Hex.</li>
        <li>The player that goes first has a slight advantage.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Strategy</h2>
    <p>Players aim to block their opponent's path while trying to create their own continuous connection. The game involves complex strategic thinking and connection-building tactics.</p>
