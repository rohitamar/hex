# Hex with Minimax AI

## Introduction 
TypeScript Web Application that implements the game of [Hex (or Nash)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) against an AI. The AI is built using the minimax algorithm with a custom Dijkstra-based heuristic function.  

## Future Developments 
- Eventually figure out other ways of optimizing the move search (try out MTCS)
- Cache the move searching to increase speed
